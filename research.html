<h3 class="major">Exoplanet Demographics</h3>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/science/kepler-planets-earth-like-census.html"><span class="image main"><img src="images/two_sizes.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
With large samples of planets we can begin to measure the statistical properties of the exoplanet population.
I am interested in two big-picture questions about exoplanets:
<ul>
	<li>What percentage of stars like our sun host exoplanets?</li>
	<li>What is the overall distribution of exoplanet masses and sizes?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I discovered that planets smaller than Neptune tend to come in one of two distinct
size classes. This observation has significant implications for planet formation theories.
The size class in which a planet falls also tells us about that planet's composition and
can allow us to distinguish between rocky super-Earths, and gaseous mini-Neptunes.
</p>
<p>
My ongoing APF-50 survey is designed to perform a similar measurement but by measuring
planet masses instead of sizes. We are systematically and autonomously surveying 
a sample of bright, nearby stars using the APF. I hope to measure the masses of a
statistically useful sample of nearby planets in order to infer the underlying
distribution of planet masses  in the local part of the galaxy.

Telescope automation is the way forward in observational astronomy.
Cutting edge research requires massive datasets that can not be collected by
humans manually driving telescopes from star to star. Advances in computing and
weather monitoring have allowed software to take the night shift, freeing up more time for
astronomers to analyze and interpret the data. I wrote much of the high-level
automation software that runs the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/apf.html">Automated Planet Telescope</a> 
(APF) at Lick Observatory. This telescope is now operating autonomously every clear night, 
surveying bright, nearby stars for Earth-like planets.

<h3 class="major">Doppler Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>I am primarily interested in measuring the masses, locations, and
frequency of nearby exoplanets. I use high-resolution optical spectrographs to
precisely measure the Doppler shifts stars as they wobble under the gravitational
influence of orbiting planets.
