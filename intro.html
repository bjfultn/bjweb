<p>I am a PhD candidate in observational astrophysics at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.
I specialize in the detection and characterization of planets orbiting stars other then our Sun (exoplanets)
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a>.</p>

<p>I currently live in Pasadena, CA with my wife and our two pets. I am working as a visiting graduate student at the
California Institute of Technology (CIT, Caltech).</p>

<p>Outside of discovering planets I enjoy <a href="#photography">
digital photography</a> and racing my Nissan 350Z at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Driver_Education">
track</a> and <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/what-is-autocross">autocross</a> events.
