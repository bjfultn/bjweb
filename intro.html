<p>I am currently a research scientist at the <a
href="http://nexsci.caltech.edu">NASA Exoplanet Science Institute</a>
(NExScI) and the <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/NNExplore/">NN-EXPLORE</a> project scientist.
I obtained M.S. and PhD degrees in astronomy from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a B.S. in 
Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
I specialize in the detection and characterization of planets orbiting stars other than our Sun (exoplanets)
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a>.</p>

<p>I currently live in Estes Park, CO with my wife Amanda and our three pets. 
Besides discovering alien worlds, I enjoy <a href="#photography">
digital photography</a> and racing my Porsche Cayman S at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Driver_Education">
track</a> and <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/what-is-autocross">autocross</a> events.
