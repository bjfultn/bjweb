<p>I am currently a research scientist at the <a href="http://nexsci.caltech.edu">NASA Exoplanet Science Institute</a> (NExScI).
I obtained M.S. and PhD degrees in astronomy from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a B.S. in 
Physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
I specialize in the detection and characterization of planets orbiting stars other than our Sun (exoplanets)
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a>.</p>

<p>I currently live in Pasadena, CA with my wife Amanda and our two pets. 
Besides discovering alien worlds, I enjoy <a href="#photography">
digital photography</a> and racing my Nissan 350Z at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Driver_Education">
track</a> and <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/what-is-autocross">autocross</a> events.
